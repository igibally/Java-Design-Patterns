2- prototype pattern
1- we have complex object that is costly to create , to create more instance of such class we use an existing instance of our prototype
2- prototype will allow us to make a copies of exiting object and save us having to recreates objects from scratch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- we start by create a class which will be a prototype
2- class should must implement Clone-able  interface
3- class Should declare CloneNotSupportedException in throws clause to give subClasses
4- chance to decide on whether to support cloning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
purpose of that object is to create copy of the existing object 

1- prototype are  useful when you have a large objects where majority of state is unchanged between instances and you can easily identify the state.
2- prototype registry is a class where in you can register various prototypes 
3- which other code can access to clone out instances, this solves the issue getting acess to initial state
